## Assessment

For this work sample test we will be building a small web application.
The web application will display an random users data and predict their nationality based on their name. 

To get started, clone the repository at https://github.com/Nebullam/work-sample-tests

I've stubbed out a simple express/node application that utilizes the iquidjs template engine to get you started. If you feel more comfortable utilizing another language or framework,  feel free to switch it up given the below requirements are met. 

## Requirements
- Use these free API services for this exercise: 
	- Random User API: [https://randomuser.me/api/](https://randomuser.me/api/)
	- Place of Birth Prediction API: [https://api.nationalize.io?name=nathaniel](https://api.nationalize.io/?name=nathaniel)
- When a user visits the home page, display a random users data clearly and concisely. Choose a few important pieces of data from the Random User API response.
-  Somewhere on the page, display a button that will predict the users nationality based on their name. A button click can can return a new page, a modal, a flash message, or load some html in place.
- Style the pages with CSS or your favorite CSS framework like TailwindCSS
- Use a template engine for rendering pages. The stubbed example uses liquidjs, but feel free to use any template engine you'd like based on your selected tech stack.
- Add one of the following to the project:
	- some application performance metrics
	- some helpful application logging
	- a few application tests
	- add linting to the project
